Someone should be trying to find you right now to invite you ingame.
If you think they are taking a bit long feel free to ask for an invite to the clan in the clan chat or in the 'Zer0PvMHelp' friends chat.

I have already given you your rank on the Zer0 PvM Discord, you should be able to see and use #ranks-chat and other channels now.
If you signed up for the Zer0 website, you should also be able to use the zer0pvm.com forums now.

What you should do right now:
- check out the #role-assign channel on the Zer0 discord
  You can sign up for pvm notifications there like @Notify Raids, rago, aod or the learner channel tags. Just react by clicking the emoji's under the posts in that channel to sign up for any that you're interested in.
  You should also use these yourself in #ranks-chat when you feel like doing some group pvm! It lets people know what you are interested in and at what times, keep doing it and you'll have people to play with in no time.
- check out the #dps-tags channel for a 5 minute dps challenge if you havent done one yet.
  Getting the minimum score (170k dpm) in one of the styles is a req for your next rankup. If you feel like you can pass one ask a staff member to watch you do it or post a video.
  Make sure to check the rules and tips in the pinned messages of that channel, and ask for help if you're struggling! The dps challenge is not about being elitists, we do them to help you find tricks to make pvm easier :)

There is a lot more great info in the discord, and great pvmers, so check out the rest and ask away if you want to learn new shit.

That is all for now, i'm just a discord bot, so there's no need to respond here, but take a minute to read the info :)
