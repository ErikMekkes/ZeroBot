Someone should be trying to find you right now to invite you ingame.
If you think it's taking too long just ask for an invite in the clan chat or in the 'Zer0PvMHelp' friends chat.

I have already given you your rank on the Zer0 PvM Discord, you should be able to see and use <#381062945041285121> and other channels now.
If you signed up for the Zer0 website, you should also be able to use the zer0pvm.com forums now.

What you should do right now:
**- check out the <#499429238282256404> channel on the Zer0 discord**
  You can sign up for pvm notifications there like @Notify Raids, rago, aod or the learner channel tags. Just react by clicking the emoji's under the posts in that channel to sign up for any that you're interested in. Challenge: Try to use one this week to host something yourself in <#381062945041285121> and whenever you feel like doing some group pvm! It lets people know what you are interested in and at what times, keep doing it and you'll have people to play with in no time. You dont need to be a pro to host something, just say you're new at it and use the learner tags. Prepare a bit by reading / watching, set up a time and find people for it! If you put in that effort you'll find a pro who'd be happy to help out in no time. Or in the worst case just have fun and learn with the others who want to try it out, that's how we all started on the release day of bosses anyway.
**- check out the <#755476342815981641> channel for a 5 minute dpm challenge**
  Getting 170k dpm in one of the styles is a req for your next rankup. If you feel like you can pass one ask a staff member to watch you do it or post a video in <#755473609342058619>. Make sure to check the rules and tips in the <#755476342815981641> channel, and ask for help if you're struggling! The dps challenge is not about being elitists, but to help you find tricks to make pvm easier :)
