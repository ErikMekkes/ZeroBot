Advice (for those that want to help as well):

Be talkative! let people know you're here.

For solo only bosses, use <#755485394778194000> for advice. That channel is more active and the advice will stay visible and useful for others.
Some bosses can be solod or done in a group, it's fine to ask for help to do those together (people telling you to just solo them arent exactly helping)

Some boss groups occasionally host masses in fc's where you can get the kc in a large group, ask when / where you can find them.
(its good to help eachother find masses if there are any planned soon, but dont use it as an excuse to not help further)

Notify pings and friendlybot -host templates are allowed in here, but please dont just spam pings, have a plan or some interest from others first.

You should enable discord pings for all messages in your channel. This way you wont miss it if others are interested in helping you.
You can do this by right clicking your channel and selecting 'All Messages' under Notification Settings:
