#!/bin/sh
# This is a very simple shell script that pulls the latest version from the git repo
# and starts the bot using the main python file in the install environment.
#
# If you have no need for pulling the latest code version from github each time the bot
# restarts just forget about this file and read the info in listbot.service
#
# Troubleshooting:
# - Make sure you have access to the git repository
# - Make sure you have ssh, git and a private key ready if you need them to access git.
# - make sure the .venv for python has the required libraries installed
#   - gspread, gspread_formatting, google-auth, oauth2client, requests, discord.py, numpy
# - make sure the folder names are correct and you have read/write/execute access for them

# check ssh is active and add the private key to access git repo if it needs one.
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add /home/zbot/.ssh/zbot@ubuzbot_2022-08-06
# switch to the git folder and pull latest version, make sure it's on the right branch.
cd /mnt/shared/Zer0Bot
git stash
git pull
git stash pop
# start the actual listbot python code.
