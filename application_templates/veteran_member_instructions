For the last requirement you have two options:
**Option one - boss knowledge:** Either show 6 casual boss tags or 2 exp tags, head over to <#755476321609580635> to check which ones you qualify for. You can show that you have the requirements by posting them here and we'll give you the tag.
**Option two - clan activity:** having 150 total activity points from any source (clan xp, drops, help the clan, achievements). If you already gathered enough points, we'll check and there's no need to do anything. If you still need to gather a few more check out the <#750029809169727568> channel for things that reward points. You can leave this app open and post them here if you are only missing a few.
