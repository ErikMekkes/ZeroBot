check out the advanced tabs on <https://runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_PvM_perk_setup> for those.
Or read the suggestions and explanations in the perks channels on the PvME discord: <https://discord.gg/6djqFVN>

To start, please reply with screenshots or a video that shows you have those requirements
**these should have your ingame name or chat visible somewhere.**
You can copy paste (ctrl+v) images directly into this discord chat from your computer's snipping tool.

**- show your ingame skill levels, show that you have all the required skills trained** 
**- show your gear and perks, you need the minimum gear and perks for 2 combat styles**
  - reminder for range or mage: you must also show an extra switch weapon with the planted feet perk
**- show your ingame list of boss kills, these wont affect your application, we're just curious.**
