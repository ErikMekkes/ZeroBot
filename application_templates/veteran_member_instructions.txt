if already you have the DPM and Boss Tags, we can see them, no need to post anything.

if you're missing some, you can get them by posting your proof here or in <#755473609342058619> 
 - DPM tags: Two Adept DPM Tags, or one Master DPM Tag. Just like the previous ones, see the <#755476342815981641> channel for rules, guides, tips and recording instructions. Practise a bit, and when you think you can pass one you can record your attempt and post the video here, or if you cant record just ask us and we'll watch you do it. Use a challenge gem (sold at the ge) or runemetrics to track your damage ingame.
 - Boss tags: Either 6 Casual or 2 Exp Boss tags, head over to <#755476321609580635> to check which ones you qualify for.
