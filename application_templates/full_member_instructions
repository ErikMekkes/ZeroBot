To start, add some screenshots to show that you have the required gear and aura / ability unlocks, **your screenshots should have your ingame name or chat visible.**

If you already have a dpm tag, we can see it, no need to show anything new. If you do not have a dpm tag yet you will need to get the minimum score of 170k dpm in one of the styles. Check the rules in the image below, practise a bit, and when you think you can pass one let us know and we’ll either watch you do it or you can record your attempt and post the video here. You can use a challenge gem (sold on the ge) or runemetrics to track your damage ingame. See the #dpm-tags channel for guides, tips and recording instructions.

If you’re confused or struggling with the dpm tags, just ask and we’ll help you out. It’s not to be elitists, we’re doing them to help you learn more about abilities, dps rotations and gear  advantages.
