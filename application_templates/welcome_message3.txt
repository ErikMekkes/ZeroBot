The PVM Encyclopedia Discord : https://discord.gg/6djqFVN
This discord has excellent information from top pvmers on all bosses, including gear setups, mechanics and tactics. You'll have to join it first for the links below to work.
It also has a lot of generic info channels for pvming, such as interface and keybind layout suggestions, dps tips and which abilities you should prioritise, suggested gear upgrades or unlocks you should work towards.

Channel with suggested upgrades to work on: https://discordapp.com/channels/534508796639182860/689236598847701075
Channel with suggested perks to put on your weapons and armour: https://discordapp.com/channels/534508796639182860/689236234912137266
You should already have the 'entry level' ones, but try to work towards the best combos eventually. See rs wiki or https://discordapp.com/channels/534508796639182860/553632787639435284 for the combinations needed to make them.

A Planted feet switch is a must have if maging or ranging : <https://runescape.wiki/w/Planted_Feet> (get pf+as1 put on a cywir wand or mainhand shadow glaive)
Flanking switch is a very important upgrade for group bosses : <https://runescape.wiki/w/Flanking> (try at least once for flank 3 or 4, put it on a separate offhand weapon)
