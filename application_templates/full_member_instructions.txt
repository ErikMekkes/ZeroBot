To start, add some screenshots to show that you have the required gear and aura / ability unlocks, **your screenshots should have your ingame name or chat visible.**

If you already have the dpm and boss tags, you can skip the parts below, no need to do anything else.

If you do not have a Casual or higher tag for PvM experience at a boss yet, head over to <#755476321609580635> and see if you qualify for one of them. You can show that you have the requirements by posting them here and we'll give you the tag.

If you do not have a DPM Tag yet you will need to get at least an Initiate DPM Tag in one of the styles. See the <#755476342815981641> channel for rules, guides, tips and recording instructions. Practise a bit, and when you think you can pass one you can record your attempt and post the video here, or if you cant record just ask us and we'll watch you do it. You can use a challenge gem (sold at the pvm hub or on the ge) or runemetrics to track your damage ingame. 

If you're confused by or struggling with the DPM or Boss Tags, just ask and we'll help you out. These tests are not about being elitist, we want to help you learn new bosses and PvM skills!
