To start, add some screenshots to show that you have the required gear and aura / ability unlocks, **your screenshots should have your ingame name or chat visible.**

If you already have the dpm and boss tags, you can skip the parts below, no need to do anything else.

If you do not have a Casual or higher tag for PvM experience at a boss yet, head over to <#755476321609580635> and see if you qualify for one of them. You can show that you have the requirements by posting them here and we'll give you the tag.

If you do not have a dpm tag yet you will need to get the minimum score of 170k dpm in one of the styles. Check the rules in the image below, practise a bit, and when you think you can pass one let us know and we'll either watch you do it or you can record your attempt and post the video here. You can use a challenge gem (sold on the ge) or runemetrics to track your damage ingame. See the <#755476342815981641> channel for guides, tips and recording instructions.

If you're confused by or struggling with the dpm or boss tags, just ask and we'll help you out. These tests are not about being elitist, we want to help you learn new bosses and pvm skills!
