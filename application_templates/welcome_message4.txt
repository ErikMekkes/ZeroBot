Reminder: our clan is almost always at the ingame member limit! this means we need to make space for new members like you regularly!
to avoid being kicked and having to re-apply, log in occasionally and do something ingame, or notify us if you plan on going inactive for more than a few weeks.
we also expect you to rank up to full member, if this takes you longer than 3 months you might also be removed for clan space and will have to re-apply.
