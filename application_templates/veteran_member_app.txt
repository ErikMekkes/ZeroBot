With the advanced rank you already made all the reasonable pvm upgrades. The veteran rank shows you have great knowledge of how to use it, and that you know most bosses or have been active for Zer0 for a long time.

To rank up from advanced to veteran member, you need to pass the next level of dpm tags. You can either show two 180k styles, or one 200k tag. Just like the previous ones, check the rules in the image below, practise a bit, and when you think you can pass one let us know and we'll either watch you do it or you can record your attempt and post the video here. You can use a challenge gem (sold on the ge) or runemetrics to track your damage ingame. See the <#755476342815981641> channel for guides, tips and recording instructions.
