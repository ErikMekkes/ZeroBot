With the advanced rank you already made all the reasonable pvm upgrades. The veteran rank shows you have great knowledge of how to use it, and that you know most bosses or have been active for Zer0 for a long time.

To rank up from advanced to veteran member, you need to pass the next level of DPM Tags. You can either show two Adept DPM Tags, or one Master DPM Tag. Just like the previous ones, see the <#755476342815981641> channel for rules, guides, tips and recording instructions. Practise a bit, and when you think you can pass one you can record your attempt and post the video here, or if you cant record just ask us and we'll watch you do it. You can use a challenge gem (sold at the pvm hub or on the ge) or runemetrics to track your damage ingame.
