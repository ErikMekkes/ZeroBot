Imagine not having a specialist rank at a boss? Are you even gaming?
Get 5 of them, or can you show that you're an actual god at one of them?

You need to already be an advanced member or higher to apply for this rank. See the <755476321609580635> channel for specialist tag requirements for each boss. (nex and rax only count as 0.5 each)
