To start, add some screenshots to show that you have the required gear and pvm unlocks, **your screenshots should have your ingame name or chat visible.**

Next up you'll need to pass the next level of dpm tags, you can either show two 170k styles, or one 180k tag. Just like the previous ones, check the rules in the image below, practise a bit, and when you think you can pass one let us know and we'll either watch you do it or you can record your attempt and post the video here. You can use a challenge gem (sold on the ge) or runemetrics to track your damage ingame. See the <#755476342815981641> channel for guides, tips and recording instructions.

For the last requirement you have two options:
**Option one - boss knowledge:** Either show 3 casual boss tags or 1 exp tags, head over to <#755476321609580635> to check which ones you qualify for. You can show that you have the requirements by posting them here and we'll give you the tag.
**Option two - clan activity:** having 75 total activity points from any source (clan xp, drops, help the clan, achievements). If you already gathered enough points, we'll check and there's no need to do anything. If you still need to gather a few more check out the <#750029809169727568> channel for things that reward points. You can leave this app open and post them here if you are only missing a few.
