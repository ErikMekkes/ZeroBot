Imagine not having a specialist rank at a boss? Are you even gaming?
Get 6 of them, or can you show that you're an actual god at two of them?

```Masterclass PvMer:```
- Must have six specialist boss tags, God boss tags again count as three.
- Must have all the gear / PvM unlocks from Supreme PvMer and lower ranks.

See the <#755476321609580635> channel for specialist tag requirements for each boss.
