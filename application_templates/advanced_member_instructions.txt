To start, add some screenshots to show that you have the required gear and pvm unlocks, **your screenshots should have your ingame name or chat visible.**

Next up you'll need to pass the next level of DPM Tags, either show two Initiate DPM Tags, or one Adept DPM Tag. Just like the previous ones, see the <#755476342815981641> channel for rules, guides, tips and recording instructions. Practise a bit, and when you think you can pass one you can record your attempt and post the video here, or if you cant record just ask us and we'll watch you do it. Use a challenge gem (sold at the pvm hub or on the ge) or runemetrics to track your damage ingame.

For the last requirement you have two options:
**Option one - boss knowledge:** Either show 3 casual boss tags or 1 exp tags, head over to <#755476321609580635> to check which ones you qualify for. You can show that you have the requirements by posting them here and we'll give you the tag.
**Option two - clan activity:** having 75 total activity points from any source (clan xp, drops, help the clan, achievements). If you already gathered enough points, we'll check and there's no need to do anything. If you still need to gather a few more check out the <#750029809169727568> channel for things that reward points. You can leave this app open and post them here if you are only missing a few.
