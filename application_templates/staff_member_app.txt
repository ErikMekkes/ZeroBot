This one isn't like the other rankups (do staff members even play the game?)

We are almost always looking for more staff members to help manage the clan, deal with applications, keeping everything working and up to date, and sorting out issues and conflicts. However, this is not a 'pass the line and you'll get the reward' form, there isn't a reward actually (except good karma), it's more like asking if you're willing to take on a small unpaid side job to help out the clan.

It is up to you to convince us that you're serious about helping out and working together. If we feel you might not be the right fit for the team right now, you could be rejected. We have some starting questions below that might help. When you feel like you're done, tag one of the leaders.

We might ask you more questions if there is anything we feel needs to be cleared up, feel free to ask any questions you might have as well of course.

Once that is done we will hide this channel from you, to discuss your application privately with the staff team and to make a decision.
That decision could take a few days, we do not rush these, but feel free to ask for an update occasionally.
