Hello, this one isn't like the others (do staff members even play the game?).

We are almost always looking for more staff members to help manage the clan, deal with applications, keeping everything working and up to date, and sorting out issues and conflicts. However, this is not a 'pass the line and you'll get the reward' form, there isn't a reward actually (except good karma), it's basically asking if you're willing to take on a small unpaid side job to help out the clan.

It's up to you to convince us that you're serious about helping out and working together. If we feel you might not be the right fit for the team right now, you could be rejected.
