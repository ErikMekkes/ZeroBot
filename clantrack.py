'''
Almost entirely self contained, need to work out:
- code that calls updatelist (timer and command)    make new cog for tracking?
- zerobot_common.rs_api_clan_name       only used here but ok as setting, move retrieve here
- zerobot_common.logfile                make one here? in cog? both should work its append?
- zerobot_common.drive_connect()        not bad, maybe utility but needs drive stuff?
- zerobot_common.current_members_sheet  ok common use
- zerobot_common.old_members_sheet      ok common use
- zerobot_common.recent_changes_sheet   ok common use
