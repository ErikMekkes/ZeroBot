You are welcome to join our chats as a guest to hang out and ask questions.
The clan chat is open to guests at all times except during warbands waves with Zer0 WBS.

However as a guest, we do not allow *you* to form or ask for teams in the clan chat or discord. This simple rule exists to keep trolls and scammers out of our pvm.
We are welcoming to learners, and you *can* politely ask a clan host if you could join their group, it will be up to them whether to take you or not. But we are not a reaper crew leech / pvm carry service, if you ask to join a team we expect that you put in some effort to learn and meet the minimum reqs.

For this guest application, just wait here until a staff member confirms or denies your request.
